Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio. I received my Graduate Data Science Certificate from UW-Oshkosh in 2022.
During my schooling we used a lot of R for machine learning and not much python so I figured I would figure out how to apply what I learned in R to Python.
I had help. I bought the vook Hands-on MAchine LEarning with Scikit-LEarn, Keras and TensorFlow by Aurelien Geron. This is a great book. It goes through all the basic Machine Learning Algorithms.
