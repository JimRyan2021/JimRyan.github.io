Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio. I received my Graduate Data Science Certificate from UW-Oshkosh in 2022.
During my schooling we used a lot of R for machine learning and not much python so I figured I would figure out how to apply what I learned in R to Python.

My favorite one is probably the NFL Combine one. Not only do I love football but I came up with the idea, scraped the text and coded it on my own. That took several months as it was my first time using many of these algorithms in Python. Much different than using them in R. 

The Python and Postgres is code from a Udemy course I took called The complete Pythin Postgres course 2.0. I enjoyed the course as it taught things like connection pooling etc.
